This small module parses the PES section of a [MCTDH operator file](https://www.pci.uni-heidelberg.de/tc/usr/mctdh/doc/mctdh/input.html) to generate the corresponding SOP representaion. It can also be used to generate geometries on different multidimensional grids or with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo process. As a working example, a HONO molecule [PES](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1632471) is used.
